    'CORRECT: Digoxin and potassium compete for the same binding sites on the Na+/K+ ATPase pump. Low K+ = more digoxin binds = TOXICITY.

THE MECHANISM EXPLAINED:
Digoxin works by inhibiting Na+/K+ pump → increases intracellular Na+ → triggers Na+/Ca++ exchanger → more Ca++ in cells → stronger contraction. When K+ is low, digoxin binds more readily, amplifying all these effects to dangerous levels.

WHY OTHER ANSWERS ARE WRONG:
• Hyperkalemia = Actually PROTECTIVE against digoxin toxicity (competes with dig for binding sites)
• Hypernatremia = Not directly related to digoxin toxicity
• Hypercalcemia = Can enhance digoxin effects but hypokalemia is the classic answer

ELECTROLYTES TO MONITOR WITH DIGOXIN:
• Potassium (hypokalemia increases toxicity)
• Magnesium (hypomagnesemia increases toxicity)
• Calcium (hypercalcemia enhances effects)

WHY HYPOKALEMIA OCCURS WITH DIGOXIN USE:
Often patients take DIURETICS with digoxin for heart failure. Loop and thiazide diuretics cause K+ loss → increased dig toxicity risk. This is why K+-sparing diuretics or K+ supplements are often co-prescribed.

    'CORRECT: MAOIs prevent breakdown of tyramine. Foods high in tyramine cause severe, potentially fatal hypertensive crisis.

TYRAMINE-RICH FOODS TO AVOID:
• Aged cheeses (cheddar, blue, Swiss, parmesan)
• Cured/smoked meats (pepperoni, salami, bacon, hot dogs)
• Red wine, beer, tap beer especially
• Fermented foods (sauerkraut, kimchi, soy sauce, miso)

    'Administer pain medication and IV fluids',
    '["Apply ice to affected areas", "Restrict fluids", "Encourage deep breathing exercises only"]',
    'CORRECT: Vaso-occlusive crisis causes SEVERE pain (often requires opioids) and dehydration worsens sickling. Hydration is crucial.

SICKLE CELL CRISIS TYPES:
1. VASO-OCCLUSIVE (most common): Sickling → vessel occlusion → ischemia → PAIN
2. SPLENIC SEQUESTRATION: Blood pools in spleen → hypovolemic shock, palpable spleen
3. APLASTIC: Parvovirus B19 → bone marrow suppression → severe anemia
4. HEMOLYTIC: Increased RBC destruction → worsening anemia

PRIORITY INTERVENTIONS FOR VASO-OCCLUSIVE CRISIS:
1. PAIN MANAGEMENT
   - Severe pain requires opioids (morphine, hydromorphone)
   - Don''t undertreat - this is real, severe pain
   - PCA pump often appropriate
2. HYDRATION
   - IV fluids (D5W 1/2 NS or NS)
   - Dehydration increases sickling
3. OXYGEN (if hypoxic)
   - Not routinely needed if SpO2 normal
   - Hypoxia triggers sickling

WHY OTHER ANSWERS ARE WRONG:
• Apply ice = COLD triggers sickling - use HEAT for comfort
• Restrict fluids = OPPOSITE - need aggressive hydration
• Deep breathing only = Pain management is priority; breathing exercises are adjunct

TRIGGERS TO AVOID:
• Dehydration
• Cold temperature
• High altitude
• Infection
• Stress

LONG-TERM MANAGEMENT:
• Hydroxyurea (increases fetal hemoglobin)
• Folic acid supplementation
• Prophylactic penicillin (functional asplenia)
• Vaccinations (especially pneumococcal)',

    'CORRECT: RhoGAM (Rh immune globulin) prevents Rh sensitization in Rh-negative mothers carrying Rh-positive babies.

RhoGAM TIMING:
• 28 weeks gestation (routine antepartum dose)
• Within 72 hours after delivery (if baby is Rh-positive)
• After any event with risk of fetal-maternal hemorrhage

ADDITIONAL INDICATIONS FOR RhoGAM:
• Miscarriage or elective abortion
• Ectopic pregnancy
• Amniocentesis, CVS
• Abdominal trauma during pregnancy
• Placental abruption or previa with bleeding
• External cephalic version

WHY OTHER ANSWERS ARE WRONG:
• Only after delivery = Need prenatal dose at 28 weeks (fetal cells may cross in 3rd trimester)
• Only if antibodies present = Once antibodies form, RhoGAM won''t help; it PREVENTS sensitization
• Every visit = Not necessary; specific timing is important

Rh SENSITIZATION EXPLAINED:
• Rh-negative mother + Rh-positive baby = Risk of sensitization
• Fetal RBCs enter maternal circulation → mother makes anti-Rh antibodies
• FIRST pregnancy usually okay (sensitization occurs at delivery)
• SUBSEQUENT pregnancies: Antibodies cross placenta → attack fetal RBCs → hemolytic disease

RhoGAM contains anti-D antibodies that destroy any Rh-positive fetal cells before mother can make her own antibodies.

• Have patient push = Pushing drives presenting part onto cord, compresses it more

CORD PROLAPSE RISK FACTORS:
• Premature rupture of membranes
• Polyhydramnios (cord floats)

• Decreased need for sleep
• Pressured speech, racing thoughts
• Increased activity and energy
• Distractibility
• Impulsive behavior (spending sprees, sexual indiscretion)
• Grandiosity
• Poor judgment

WHY OTHER ANSWERS ARE WRONG:

NURSING INTERVENTIONS FOR MANIA:
• SAFETY: Protect from impulsive behavior
• Low stimulation: Quiet environment, reduced people
• Consistent boundaries: Firm limits with calm manner
• Nutrition: High-calorie finger foods (won''t sit to eat)
• Sleep: Darkened room, bedtime routine (though may not sleep)

WHY COMPLETION IS CRITICAL:
• Incomplete treatment = surviving bacteria become resistant
• Drug-resistant TB is extremely difficult to treat

    'CORRECT: Staying upright allows gravity to keep stomach contents down. Lying down promotes reflux of acid into esophagus.

GERD LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS:
• Remain upright 2-3 hours after eating
• Elevate head of bed 6-8 inches (blocks, not pillows)
• Eat small, frequent meals
• Avoid tight clothing
• Lose weight if overweight
• Avoid eating before bedtime

WHY OTHER ANSWERS ARE WRONG:
• Large meals = Increase gastric distention, worsen reflux
• Lie down after meals = Promotes reflux; gravity works against you
• Fluids with meals = Increases gastric volume; drink between meals instead

FOODS TO AVOID:
• Fatty/fried foods (slow emptying)
• Citrus, tomatoes (acidic)
• Chocolate, peppermint (relax LES)
• Caffeine, alcohol
• Carbonated beverages
• Spicy foods

MEDICATIONS FOR GERD:
• Antacids (quick relief)
• H2 blockers (famotidine) - reduce acid production
• PPIs (omeprazole, pantoprazole) - most effective
• Prokinetic agents (metoclopramide) - speed emptying

WHEN TO SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION:
• Difficulty swallowing
• Painful swallowing
• Unintentional weight loss
• GI bleeding
• Symptoms not controlled with OTC medications

COMPLICATIONS OF UNTREATED GERD:
• Esophagitis
• Barretts esophagus (precancerous)

EFFECTS OF EXCESS CORTISOL:
• Hyperglycemia (insulin resistance → "steroid diabetes")
• Osteoporosis (bone breakdown)
• Muscle wasting
• Immunosuppression (infection risk)
• Poor wound healing
• Hypertension
• Hypokalemia
• Sodium and water retention

    'CORRECT: Fat embolism occurs 24-72 hours after LONG BONE fractures. Fat globules enter bloodstream and can lodge in lungs, brain, skin.

FAT EMBOLISM SYNDROME (FES):

TRIAD OF SYMPTOMS:
1. Respiratory distress (dyspnea, tachypnea, hypoxia)
2. Neurological changes (confusion, agitation)
3. Petechial rash (chest, axilla, neck) - pathognomonic

TIMING:
• Usually 24-72 hours after fracture
• Can occur after orthopedic surgery too
• Most common with femur and pelvis fractures

WHY OTHER ANSWERS ARE WRONG:
• Osteomyelitis = Bone infection; develops later (days to weeks)
• Avascular necrosis = Blood supply loss; develops over weeks to months
• Nonunion = Failure to heal; determined months later

RISK FACTORS:
• Long bone fractures (femur, tibia, pelvis)
• Multiple fractures
• Orthopedic surgery
• Young adults

NURSING INTERVENTIONS:
• Early immobilization of fracture
• Careful handling during transport
• Monitor respiratory status closely
• O2 and supportive care if FES develops
• Monitor mental status

PREVENTION:
• Early fracture stabilization
• Gentle handling
• Adequate hydration
• Avoid excessive manipulation',

    'CORRECT: Weights maintain proper traction force. Weights on floor = no traction = loss of alignment and increased pain. Restore proper position.

TRACTION PRINCIPLES:
• Weights provide constant pull
• Must hang freely at all times
• Never rest on floor or bed
• Never remove weights without order (except emergency)

SKELETAL TRACTION:
• Pin/wire through bone
• Heavier weights than skin traction
• For fractures requiring strong, constant pull

WHY OTHER ANSWERS ARE WRONG:
• Remove weights = Would lose all traction; only in emergency
• Add more weights = Not indicated; restore proper position first
• Call surgeon immediately = Correct the problem first, then notify if needed

TRACTION NURSING CARE:
• Check weights hanging freely every shift
• Check ropes in pulleys (not frayed, moving freely)
• Maintain proper alignment
• Assess neurovascular status (5 Ps)
• Pin care for skeletal traction
• Prevent skin breakdown

PHANTOM LIMB SENSATIONS:
PHANTOM LIMB SENSATION:
• Awareness of missing limb
• Non-painful sensations (tingling, itching, movement)
• Very common (80%+ of amputees)

PHANTOM LIMB PAIN:
• Actual pain perceived in missing limb
• Burning, cramping, shooting, aching

    'CORRECT: Bisphosphonates irritate esophagus. Must take upright with water to ensure it reaches stomach and doesnt reflux.

ALENDRONATE (FOSAMAX) ADMINISTRATION:
• Take first thing in morning
• On empty stomach (food decreases absorption by 40%)
• With full glass (8 oz) of plain WATER only
• Remain UPRIGHT (sitting or standing) for 30 minutes
• Dont lie down, dont eat for 30 minutes

WHY UPRIGHT POSITION:
• Prevents esophageal irritation
• Reduces risk of esophagitis, ulcers, strictures
• Gravity helps tablet reach stomach

WHY OTHER ANSWERS ARE WRONG:
• With breakfast = Food greatly reduces absorption
• At bedtime = Must remain upright; would lie down
• With calcium = Calcium interferes with absorption; separate by 30+ min

BISPHOSPHONATE FACTS:
• Inhibit osteoclast activity (bone breakdown)
• Increase bone density
• Reduce fracture risk
• Take weekly (most common) or daily

SIDE EFFECTS:
• GI upset, esophagitis (most common)
• Osteonecrosis of jaw (rare, mostly with IV form)
• Atypical femur fractures (rare, long-term use)
• Flu-like symptoms (first dose)

CONTRAINDICATIONS:

BUCK TRACTION:
• Skin traction (applied to skin, not bone)
• Lower weight than skeletal traction (5-10 lbs)
• Used for hip fractures temporarily (before surgery)
• Reduces muscle spasms and pain
• Maintains alignment

EFFECTIVE TRACTION INDICATORS:
• Proper body alignment
• Slight hip flexion (10-20 degrees)
• Weights hanging freely

BUCK TRACTION NURSING CARE:
• Check skin under boot/wrap regularly
• Assess for skin breakdown
• Neurovascular checks
• Keep weights hanging freely
• Maintain proper alignment
• Remove boot periodically for skin assessment (per orders)

CENTRAL VS PERIPHERAL CYANOSIS:

CENTRAL CYANOSIS (Emergency):
• Blue lips, tongue, mucous membranes
• Blue trunk/torso
• Indicates systemic hypoxia
• Requires immediate action

PERIPHERAL CYANOSIS/ACROCYANOSIS (Normal in newborns):
• Blue hands and feet only
• Central areas PINK
• Normal in first 24-48 hours
• Due to immature circulation

WHY OTHER ANSWERS ARE WRONG:
• Acrocyanosis = Normal in newborns up to 48 hours
• Mottled skin = Can be normal with cold or normal circulation changes
• Mild jaundice day 3 = Physiologic jaundice peaks day 3-5; monitor but not emergency

CAUSES OF CENTRAL CYANOSIS IN NEWBORNS:
• Congenital heart defects
• Respiratory distress syndrome
• Pneumonia
• Meconium aspiration
• Persistent pulmonary hypertension
• Airway obstruction

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
• Stimulate breathing if needed
• Clear airway
• Provide oxygen
• Assess respiratory effort
• Check heart rate
• Call for help
• Consider resuscitation

    'CORRECT: Current guidelines state egg allergy (even severe) is NOT a contraindication for MMR, flu, or other vaccines. This is an outdated concern for most vaccines.

CURRENT EGG ALLERGY GUIDELINES:

MMR VACCINE:
• Grown in chick embryo fibroblast cells
• Does NOT contain egg protein
• Safe for egg-allergic patients
• No longer a concern

INFLUENZA VACCINE:
• Most grown in eggs (contain ovalbumin)
• CDC now says: give to egg-allergic patients
• Severe egg allergy: give in medical setting with observation
• Cell-based and recombinant options available (no egg)

YELLOW FEVER VACCINE:
• ONLY vaccine where egg allergy is true contraindication
• Contains significant egg protein

WHY OTHER ANSWERS ARE WRONG:
All listed vaccines can be given to egg-allergic patients:
• MMR = Safe, no egg protein
• Influenza = Can be given with precautions
• Varicella = Not egg-based

TRUE VACCINE CONTRAINDICATIONS:
• Severe allergic reaction to previous dose of that vaccine
• Severe allergy to vaccine COMPONENT
• For live vaccines: immunocompromised state, pregnancy

• Egg allergy prevents vaccines (mostly false)
• Minor illness prevents vaccines (false)

    'CORRECT: Incomplete antibiotic courses lead to resistant bacteria and recurrent infection. Complete full 10-day course regardless of symptom improvement.

ANTIBIOTIC COMPLIANCE TEACHING:

WHY COMPLETE THE COURSE:
• Bacteria not fully eliminated if stopped early
• Surviving bacteria may become resistant
• Infection can recur (often worse)
• Full course needed to eradicate infection

OTITIS MEDIA TREATMENT:
• First-line: Amoxicillin 80-90 mg/kg/day
• Duration: 10 days (under age 2)
• Duration: 5-7 days (over age 2, mild)
• If allergic: azithromycin or cephalosporin

WHY OTHER ANSWERS ARE WRONG:
• Stop when pain resolves = Symptoms improve before bacteria eliminated
• Give only with fever = Need consistent dosing, not PRN
• Skip doses = Inconsistent levels allow bacterial survival

ADMINISTRATION TIPS:
• Give at same times daily
• Complete entire prescription
• Store properly (refrigerate if liquid)
• Use measuring device (not household spoons)
• Can give with food if GI upset

SIGNS OF COMPLICATIONS (Report to provider):
• Fever persisting >48-72 hours on antibiotics
• Worsening pain
• Swelling behind ear
• Drainage from ear
• Hearing changes
• Balance problems

PREVENTION:
• Breastfeeding (protective)
• Avoid bottle propping
• Avoid secondhand smoke

    'CORRECT: These are HYPOGLYCEMIA symptoms. In children, treat immediately with fast-acting carbs if symptomatic. Dont delay to check glucose.

HYPOGLYCEMIA IN CHILDREN:

SYMPTOMS:
ADRENERGIC (Early):
• Shakiness, tremors
• Sweating
• Pallor
• Tachycardia
• Irritability, anxiety
• Hunger

NEUROGLYCOPENIC (Late):
• Confusion
• Behavior changes
• Slurred speech
• Seizures
• Loss of consciousness

WHY TREAT BEFORE TESTING:
• Symptoms are classic for hypoglycemia
• Delay can lead to seizures, brain damage
• Treatment is harmless if wrong
• "When in doubt, treat"

WHY OTHER ANSWERS ARE WRONG:
• Give insulin = Would LOWER glucose - dangerous!
• Check glucose first = Delays treatment; treat symptomatic hypoglycemia immediately
• Call parents = After treating, not before

TREATMENT IN CHILDREN:
• 15 grams fast-acting carb (4 oz juice, glucose tablets)
• Wait 15 minutes
• Recheck blood glucose
• Repeat if still <70 mg/dL
• Follow with protein/complex carb snack

IF UNCONSCIOUS OR SEIZING:
• DO NOT give oral glucose (aspiration risk)
• Glucagon injection (parents should have at home)
• Call 911
• Position safely

PREVENTION:
• Regular meals and snacks
• Check glucose before activity
• Carry fast-acting glucose always

KAWASAKI DISEASE:
• Acute febrile vasculitis of childhood
• Usually <5 years old
• Unknown cause (possibly infectious trigger)
• Leading cause of acquired heart disease in children (developed countries)

DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA (Fever + 4 of 5):
• Bilateral conjunctivitis (non-purulent)
• Oral changes (strawberry tongue, red cracked lips)
• Extremity changes (edema, erythema, later peeling)
• Rash (polymorphous)
• Cervical lymphadenopathy (>1.5 cm, usually unilateral)

WHY OTHER ANSWERS ARE WRONG:
• Skin peeling = Expected symptom, not dangerous complication
• Conjunctivitis = Part of disease, not the serious complication
• Strawberry tongue = Diagnostic feature, not concerning complication

CARDIAC COMPLICATIONS:
• Coronary artery aneurysms (20-25% if untreated)
• Myocarditis
• Pericarditis
• Arrhythmias
• MI (from aneurysm rupture or thrombosis)

TREATMENT:
• IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulin) - within 10 days of fever onset
• High-dose aspirin (anti-inflammatory)
• Low-dose aspirin continued for weeks (antiplatelet)
• Echocardiogram to monitor coronary arteries

NURSING CARE:
• Cardiac monitoring
• Monitor for signs of heart failure
• Comfort measures (irritability is common)
• Assess extremities for changes
• Monitor temperature
